# Hello all, I am sharing how to use LIMIT, BETWEEN and IN functions in SQL  

## We have already been able to perform direct comparisons against string such as `WHERE first_name = 'John'`.  
## But what if we want to match against a general pattern in a string such as All Emails ending in '@gmail.com' or all names that begin with an 'A'.  
## The LIKE operator allows us to perform pattern matching against a string data with the use of wild card characters.  
                 Percent (%) = matches any sequence of characters.
